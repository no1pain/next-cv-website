> **Note**: If the demo link isn't working yet, it's likely because:
>
> 1. The GitHub Pages deployment is still in progress (can take up to 10 minutes)
> 2. The GitHub Pages settings need to be configured properly
> 3. The repository needs to be public for GitHub Pages to work with the free plan

## ‚ùì Why Can't I See the Demo Link in GitHub Pages Settings?

If you're looking at `https://github.com/no1pain/next-cv-website/settings/pages` and don't see a demo link, here are the common reasons:

1. **First Deployment Not Complete**: The first deployment can take 5-10 minutes to complete. After that, the link will appear.

2. **Branch Not Published**: Make sure your `gh-pages` branch exists and is selected as the source in GitHub Pages settings.

3. **Build Process Failed**: Check the Actions tab in your repository to see if there were any errors in the GitHub Actions workflow.

4. **Repository Visibility**: Ensure your repository is public if you're using the free GitHub plan.

5. **Missing Index.html**: The `out` directory must contain an `index.html` file at its root.

6. **Need to Refresh**: Sometimes you need to refresh the settings page after deployment completes to see the link.

To fix this, try:

- Pushing a small change to trigger a new deployment
- Manually selecting the `gh-pages` branch in the GitHub Pages settings
- Checking the Actions tab for any build errors
- Adding a README.md file to your repository (sometimes this triggers the GitHub Pages setup)
